title: Pure Functions
---

In functional programing functions that are **effect-free**, **deterministic** & **total** are called as **pure functions**:

1. **Effect Free:** The function never performs any changes to the outside world (no side-effects).
2. **Deterministic:** Given the same input, the function will always return the same output.
3. **Total:** The function is defined over the complete set of possible input values & doesn't ever throw exceptions or produce an anomaly.
