A _real world_ program needs to deal with **side-effects**, **non determinism** and **anomalies**. Unfortunately most programming languages don't provide us with a first class support to handle any of these problems. **QIO** provides a set of type-safe abstraction that can help solve these problems elegantly using typescript.

We will try to understand these concepts a bit more. It's important to understand them because throughout the tutorial words like _pure_, _deterministic_, _total_ etc. are going to be used.

> If you know them already you can directly skip to the [tutorial] directly.
